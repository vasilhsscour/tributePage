                <h4><u>Born</u></h4>
                <p>Muddy Waters' birthplace and date are not conclusively known. He stated that he was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1915, but it is believed to be more likely that he was born in Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in
                    1913. Recent research has uncovered documentation showing that in the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card.</p>

                <p>Muddy Waters's longtime wife, Geneva, died of cancer on March 15, 1973. Gaining custody of some of his children, he moved them into his home, eventually buying a new house in Westmont, Illinois. Years later, he travelled to Florida and
                    met his future wife, 19-year-old Marva Jean Brooks, whom he nicknamed "Sunshine". Eric Clapton served as best man at their wedding in 1979. His sons, Larry "Mud" Morganfield and Big Bill Morganfield, are also blues singers and musicians.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Muddy was a master of just the right notes. It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple... <br>more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics,<br> gave profundity to the words
                        themselves!"
